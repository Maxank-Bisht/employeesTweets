# Employees Tweets

This application is an internal app for an IT department/company where the employees can come there to read or write tweets about the functioning of the company or related stuff.

For this application, I am using redux for state management and json-server as a backend technology.
In addition with reactJS, I am also using Materialize as a front-end framework.
